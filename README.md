# Currency-converter 
#### I invite you to use my currency converter. It is created for the course I am currently taking.

 It is very easy to use. It can convert EUR, USD and CHF amounts


Just enter a specific amount and select the appropriate currency. Then click the "przelicz" button and the amount in PLN is displayed below.


## Technology
In this project I used the BEM convention, as well as Java Script and Flex. The currency calculator has not been added to the server. This is the next step in the course.
